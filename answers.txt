Large Language Models are neural networks trained on huge datasets to understand and generate human-like text for various applications.
Transformers leverage self-attention to analyze word importance in context for natural language tasks.
Popular LLMs include GPT, PaLM, and LLaMA, which differ in size and training data.
Fine-tuning helps adapt a general LLM to excel in specific domains, improving accuracy and usefulness.
Zero-shot learning allows models to perform new tasks by interpreting prompts without explicit training examples.
Tokenization converts text into smaller units such as words or subwords that the model can process.
Training LLMs is challenging due to large computational needs and the requirement for extensive data.
