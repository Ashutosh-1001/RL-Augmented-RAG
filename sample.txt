Large Language Models (LLMs) are neural networks trained on massive datasets to generate human-like text across many tasks.
Transformer models use self-attention to weigh the importance of words contextually, enabling powerful language understanding.
Popular LLMs include OpenAI's GPT series, Google's PaLM, and Meta's LLaMA, known for their large parameter counts.
Training LLMs involves huge computational resources and diverse corpora of text from multiple domains.
Fine-tuning adapts these models to specific domains, boosting performance on specialized tasks like medical or legal text.
Zero-shot and few-shot learning allow LLMs to perform tasks without task-specific examples, relying on prompts instead.
Tokenization breaks raw text into tokens such as words or subwords, which serve as model inputs.
Human feedback and techniques like RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) are used to align models with human values.
Responsible AI development requires addressing biases and ethical challenges inherent in large scale language models.
